# DFT Cluster structure dataset from calculations
- `bare` - 4 bare clusters (no CO)
- `single_CO` - 69 clusters with 1 CO adsorbed each 
- `multiple_CO` 
	- 26 clusters with more than 1 CO adsorbed each 
	- 21 structures in the training set (Pd4, Pd7 and Pd20)
	- 5 structures in the testing set (Pd9, Pd13, Pd15)

In each iteraction folder, 
- CONTCAR of DFT structures
- the folder png contains the visualization of DFT structures
