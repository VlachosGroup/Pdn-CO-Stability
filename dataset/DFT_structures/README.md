# DFT Cluster structure dataset from calculations
- `bare` - 4 bare clusters (no CO)
- `single_CO` - 69 clusters with 1 CO adsorbed each 
- `multiple_CO` - 21 clusters with more than 1 CO adsorbed each 

In each iteraction folder, 
- CONTCAR of DFT structures
- the folder png contains the visualization of DFT structures
